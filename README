This repository contains the code used to construct the Docker image:

https://hub.docker.com/r/sorear/fedora-riscv-wip

---

This is the RISC-V Fedora userland from Richard W.M. Jones et al, repackaged
for Docker with the QEMU user emulator fork developed by Alex Suykov.

 * About RISC-V: https://riscv.org/
 * Fedora coordinaton page: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V
 * QEMU fork: https://github.com/arsv/riscv-qemu
 * Build script for this image: https://github.com/sorear/fedora-riscv-useremu

To set up a RISC-V userland testing environment, use:

    docker run -it sorear/fedora-riscv-wip

You will need binfmt_misc configured in order to actually use this; the
container checks this, and will print instructions (or if run with --privileged
it can do the configuration itself; don't do this if you care about the host
integrity, because that turns off the sandbox).

That image includes a large set of compiled RPMs suitable for basic
development.  You can instead download a much smaller image,
`sorear/fedora-riscv-wip:minimal`, (109 MB versus 667 MB), and download RPMs
as needed from the [coordination site][RPMS].  Once we have dnf working on
RISC-V this will probably become the preferred option.

The dev environment must be installed from RPMs using the rpm or tdnf command,
for instance:

    tdnf --releasever 25 install libffi-devel libtool-ltdl-devel m4

The files are installed in /var/tmp/RPMS, or can be downloaded with curl;
the kernel-headers package is necessary for most tasks but is not in either
image and can be fetched at:

https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/SRPMS/kernel-headers-4.1.26-1.fc25.src.rpm

A list of package that you probably want to install before trying to compile
anything is in the autobuilder:

    https://github.com/rwmjones/fedora-riscv-autobuild/blob/4b78ecf5/autobuild.ml#L174

After installing those, kernel-headers, m4, libtool-ltdl-devel, and
libffi-devel, and replacing iconv with a link to /bin/true, I was able to
rebuild the source package gforth-0.7.3-3.fc24.src.rpm as a test.
